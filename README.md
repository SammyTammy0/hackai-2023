This Github contains an example for how our backend processes Twitter and play-by-play (pbp) data. 

In this example, I am generating an image from a game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Golden State Warriors. The tweet we are looking at is "LD out here playing bully ball ðŸ¤¯" (https://t.co/BVdnaUcjhl). 

The program selects play-by-plays which occurred at least 5 minutes before the tweet was created. Then, it makes an API call to respell to determine which selected play-by-play best relates to the tweet. Then, the respell-selected play-by-play is passed to the Wombo/Dream API to generate an image of the play-by-play.

For example, the example tweet is saying LD (Luka Doncic) did something insane, then the respell call returns the most relevant play-by-play in which Luka do something insane. Then, an image is generated which shows Luka doing an insane maneuver.
